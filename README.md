SAXDVR
======

A simple implementation of XML Filter (org.xml.sax.XMLFilter) that records all SAX events and can later replay them back.

It comes with an example unit test that uses the DVR to do partial updates to the underlying XML structure. 
This question at StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10648651/how-to-preserve-xml-nodes-that-are-not-bound-to-an-object-when-using-sax-for-par) triggered the idea of the DVR and that special purpose uhnit test.
